## About Me
I'm passionate about applying AI and software engineering to solve complex, real-world problems. Currently working as a Forward Deployed Software Engineer at Palantir, where I build AI-native healthcare systems for government operations. I graduated from the University of Virginia with a B.S. in Computer Science and specialize in scalable web applications, machine learning systems, and AI-powered tools.

## Experience
- **Forward Deployed Software Engineer** at Palantir Technologies. Building critical AI-powered features for a large-scale government EHR system, including AI medical encounter summarization, permission architecture for patient portals, and lab digitization workflows serving 330,000+ patient charts globally.

- **Machine Learning Research Assistant** at UVA's FloodWatch. Built a multi-agent assistant for weather and flood risk insights, researching agentic reasoning and memory architectures to improve adaptive query handling.

- **Software Engineer** at Bronco AI (YC S23). Shipped the first iteration of an AI-powered supply chain management system from 0 to 1, implementing multithreaded AI agents that automated 85% of manual data entry tasks for clients. Later, architected and built an AI verification engineer, end-to-end.

- **Member of Technical Staff** at Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad. Deployed CARSAC, an embedded distributed security system serving 100+ members, and built real-time operational dashboards for emergency response coordination.

- **Machine Learning Research Assistant** at UVA's Computational Systems Biology Lab. Developed predictive ML models for cancer phenotype identification, achieving 94% accuracy in disease state predictions and receiving a $10,000 research grant.
